## Sidenotes:

## Unsupported CustomROM : 
**Issue** : features not enabling.  
**Solution** : Use Custom ROM which are AOSP based with pixel's system UI (preferably gapps build).

## Camera Popping out during boot :

**Issue** : Camera Popping out during boot on Xiaomi devices with pop up cameras.  
**Solution** : Use  `PixelFeatureDrops-Xiaomi` from release.


## Face Enrolment :
**Issue**: Enrollment not working because of errors with camera ( front camera not working during enrollment or switching to back camera in certain devices )  
**Solution** : Enroll your face for face unlock before flashing the module.

## Playstore system Update :
**Issue** : Unable to install playstore system update.  
**Solution** : Disable the module then reboot and then install the playstore system update after which re- enable the module from magisk folowed by a reboot.

## Safetynet:   
**Issue** : Safetynet fails.  
**Solution** :  
Make sure to install correct release otherwise it will lead to CTS Failure in safetynet
Besides that, the following steps are to be taken in general when using magisk to pass safetynet:
- Turn on magisk hide and hide for *Google PlayServices, Playstore, Google Service Framework and Carrier Services*. Besides also hide magisk manager to pass safetynet.    

- **If safetynet fails with hardware attestation** use [Kdrag0n's Safetynet Fix](https://github.com/kdrag0n/safetynet-fix/releases) which makes safetynet check to fall back to basic attestation.  
[safetynet-fix-v1.1.1.zip](https://github.com/ayush5harma/PixelFeatureDrops/files/5938557/safetynet-fix-v1.1.1.zip)

If using edxposed also follow the below steps to ensure that the safetynet passes:
- Use the latest Edxposed build with AppList mode enabled and blacklist *Google PlayServices, Playstore, Google Service Framework and Carrier Services* .
- Turn on riru hide mechanism by creating empty file *enable_hide* inside /data/adb/riru and reboot. Use riru apk to cross-check if hide is enabled.  

## Aux Lenses:  
**Issue** : Can't detect /switch to aux lenses.  
**Solution** : 
If you are using gcam port try loading appropriate config file for the gcam you are using.  
If you're using miui cam port or any other port which checks for device fingerprint you have to spoof the device fingerprint for that camera app using edxposed module (https://github.com/ikws4/WeiJu) to make it work (you may check video here [#10](https://github.com/ayush5harma/PixelFeatureDrops/issues/10#issuecomment-701601857)  and can get these variable values from your stock build.prop file.)

## HAL 3 :   
**Issue** : Playstore not listing AR services.  
**Solution** : clear playstore data
